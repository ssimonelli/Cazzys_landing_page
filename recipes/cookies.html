    </ul>

    <h5>Instructions</h5>

        <li>Add all ingredients to a bowl and stir them for 300 seconds EXACTLY</li>
        <li>Feed your cat, she's hungry</li>
        <li>Place a spoon sized glob of cookie dough on a baking sheet.
            Repeat with the rest of the dough until all of it is gone or you get tired of doing it.</li>
        <li>Bake cookie dough at 350 degrees F for about 20 minutes or cookies are burnt little pucks.</li>
